Hello there! I'm Chris Ferrario, welcome to my portfolio.

        Allow me to tell you about myself:
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span class="biotext">
            I am a six year game industry veteran and have been programming for almost 10 years, mostly C++/Java/C#.<br /> <br/>
            I started off at the small but top notch Java 2D handheld game studio DeValley Entertainment in Paris where I was lucky enough to work with and learn from 
            multi talented game geniuses who taught me the wonders of making great games that are real works of art while still being extremely portable and optimized. 
            I then used my fresh new skills at Gameloft, in New York City as well as at VG Creator in Montreuil, France to work on some more Java handheld games and one Nintendo DS game in C++,  
            but sadly the 2008 financial crisis cut both of those adventures short. Things then got much better, I landed my current job, in Gameloft Montreal 
            where I have now been for close to 4 years making awesome Apple and Android pad games!  <br><br/>
            I have worked on many programming teams, with members from 1 to 25 programmers. I've always had strong ties with my game and level designers and very forwarding in solving gameplay 
            issues as well as being pro active in trying to provide them as many useful tools as I could in between gameplay tasks. <br><br/>
            These past few years, I have been heavily involved in AI and other gameplay mechanics such as replay systems, menus, huds, reward systems, physics, sounds, level editing tools. I usually also
            have a heavy hand in building the game engine and optimizing. I'm often some sort of handy man and have been heavily involved about every part of the code apart from perhaps networking and 
            advanced 3D graphics. <br/><br/>
            I am also legally allowed to work in Canada, the US and the European Union.<br/><br/>
            I have included more details about the projects I have helped ship in the tabs on this site.

        Why I have this portfolio : 
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span class="biotext">
I am very happy in my current position, and certainly have no desire to jump to another similar studio, but this portfolio exists for a reason. I will try to be bluntly honest and 
            candid here in my explanation as I believe not being so wastes people's time. <br>
            As I get older, I realize that <i>life is not only about work</i>. Over the years, and over the studios, as many of my contemporary game programmers, 
            I have gone through the month long crunches, I have slept under my desk, not gone home for 72 hour stretches, laying it all on the line to try 
            to get projects boxed and shipped before deadlines. But these temporary hardships were never really problematic, they usually have been great team building events. 
            I have been extremely lucky to have worked with very talented on competent people, people whom I've always had something to learn from but were also lots of fun to be around. 
            Making games, discussing game systems, solving problems, as well as simply putting the headphones on to enter the "<i>Deep Programming Zone</i>" are things I can no longer live without. 
            But as I've said earlier, life is not only about work. I am now 30 years old and I am realizing that in the pursuit of my <i>dream career</i> I've selfishly left family and friends 
            behind in multiple countries and cities, I've missed cousins, aunts and uncles, parents and grand-parents all grow old without me ever finding the time to be around. 
            My life is now in Montreal, but being American-Italian raised in France, i have the fortune and the misfortune of a very international yet distant family that I miss a lot. Looking to the future, 
            I feel that traditional game studios might not provide me with the work-life balance I have started craving. Now I realize that my dream of programming for games has evolved, 
            has crystallized, and <i>life is way too short not to attempt to make your dreams a reality</i>. Today my dream is to work for and with a company or individuals that will allow me to input 
            some programming into their games, just as i have been doing these years, yet not be always required to be on site to allow me the time catch up with all the friends and family 
            that I have abroad. Working off site, or telecommuting even temporarily can be a scary proposition and is definitely not for every one, but luckily I have had an experience with it : 
            my first programming gig was a remote 3 month long non-gaming Java desktop application project during my summer break in computer school. I used this opportunity to move to Lausanne, 
            Switzerland for that summer and work remotely from there. This was an <i>immensely rewarding</i> experience where I was able to marry the programming time that I crave with time spent with 
            friends. My client was so satisfied with the work that I received follow up work spanning the next year. My hope here is that some special quirky atypical open minded and adventurous game studio is willing to give 
            me a shot at living my dream in exchange of my hard work and dedication.
