Hello there! I'm Chris Ferrario, welcome to my portfolio.

        Allow me to tell you about myself:
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span class="biotext">
            I am a six year game industry veteran and have been programming for almost 10 years, mostly C++/Java/C#.<br /> <br/>
            I started off at the small but top notch Java 2D handheld game studio DeValley Entertainment in Paris where I was lucky enough to work with and learn from 
            multi talented game geniuses who taught me the wonders of making great games that are real works of art while still being extremely portable and optimized. 
            I then used my fresh new skills at Gameloft, in New York City as well as at VG Creator in Montreuil, France to work on some more Java handheld games and one Nintendo DS game in C++,  
            but sadly the 2008 financial crisis cut both of those adventures short. Things then got much better, I landed my current job, in Gameloft Montreal 
            where I have now been for close to 4 years making awesome Apple and Android pad games!  <br><br/>
            I have worked on many programming teams, with members from 1 to 25 programmers. I've always had strong ties with my game and level designers and very forwarding in solving gameplay 
            issues as well as being pro active in trying to provide them as many useful tools as I could in between gameplay tasks. <br><br/>
            These past few years, I have been heavily involved in AI and other gameplay mechanics such as replay systems, menus, huds, reward systems, physics, sounds, level editing tools. I usually also
            have a heavy hand in building the game engine and optimizing. I'm often some sort of handy man and have been heavily involved about every part of the code apart from perhaps networking and 
            advanced 3D graphics. <br/><br/>
            I am also legally allowed to work in Canada, the US and the European Union.<br/><br/>
            I have included more details about the projects I have helped ship in the tabs on this site.

        Why I have this portfolio :

             <br>
            I am now looking for a new experience, something fresh, possibly in a new field. I feel I can use my mobile experience and my enjoyment of web programming and game programming to 
            be very productive in the right environment. I am especially interested in flexible arangements that will allow me to spend a bit more time with my family in NY and Paris while remaining in Montreal.
             <br>
             <br>
            I am very motivated and very adaptable to new tech. Let me play on your team!
             <br>
