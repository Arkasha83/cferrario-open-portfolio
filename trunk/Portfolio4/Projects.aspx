            <b>The Spiderwick Chronicles</b> is a J2ME Midp 2.0 Adventure Game developed by the French company <a href="http://www.devalley.fr">DeValley Entertainment</a> and published by <a href="http://www.vgmobile.com"/>Vivendi Universal Games Mobile</a>.<br/><br/> I was the lead programmer for the development of this project.<br/><br/> This game was created in anticipation of the upcoming Paramount movie and was a licensed product designed to target the same audience that the movie and Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's novels appeal to, such as younger audiences.<br/><br/> Vivendi Universal Games Mobile came to us with this project after we had finished Crash of the Titans, around August 2007 it seemed at the time like a good project to look into but one of the demands was very special: they would need the game to be developed in two months with one extra month of debugging, about half the time we usually spend on games. At that time the Paramount movie was expected to hit the theatres around January 2008.<br/> The other developers were already deep into other projects so I was the only one relatively available putting the finishing touches on the game Nowhere, however I had just only finished my first game as a lead developer and that had taken me about 5 months with debugging. The added responsibility did not scare me and for some reason I really felt confident I could get the job done well and in time. Luckily for me I did!<br/><br/> This project succeeded because the two guys I worked with, brothers Simon and Etienne Perin really did a tremendous job as graphic artist and game designer respectively. The graphics are really top notch and are I believe by far the best feature of the game, and Etienne's work really made everything happen. His early game design documents were right on the money, and thanks to them I was able to schedule almost all the necessary coding tasks from the start of the project, we all put in a lot of extra hours early on and we were so conscious of the tight schedule that we actually ended the project a couple days early.<br/><br/> The game was also at times frustrating to make because a lot of the creative decisions were out of our hands, we often wanted to push the gameplay further and sometimes had to simplify some of our gameplay features. However with hindsight I see now that these decisions we good marketing decisions and that the game is well tailored for its target audience.<br/> <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/writer.asp?a=63&sec=0"> Spanner Spencer</a> from Pocket Gamer wrote a review that best reflects the game : <ul> <li><a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/The+Spiderwick+Chronicles/review.asp?c=6085">Pocket Gamer.co.uk</a> Score : 7/10, Bronze Award</li> </ul> <br><br> <center> Vivendi's Game commercial <br> <br/><br/> <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fk2E3sPZgEE&hl=fr&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fk2E3sPZgEE&hl=fr&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object> <br/> <br/> Opening game of Vivendi's Game commercial: Hit Mobile Game Line-Up 2008 : <br/> <br/> <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AI6wBZzwGPM&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/AI6wBZzwGPM&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object> <br/> <br/> Gameplay Video : <br/> <br/> <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oPlabgqRz6A&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oPlabgqRz6A&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object> </center>

            <b>Nowhere</b> is a J2ME Midp 2.0 Survival Horror Game developed by the French company <a href="http://www.devalley.fr">DeValley Entertainment</a>.<br/><br/> I was the lead programmer for the development of this project and also worked on some of the porting.<br/><br/> The really interesting feature about this project was its goal to create a very disturbing atmosphere, always trying to keep the player uneasy yet wanting to discover the rest of the game, just like the feelings that can be experienced when watching a classic horror movie.<br /><br /> I am especially proud of having worked on this game, but to present it a little more objectively, I will refer you to some of the reviews : <ul> <li><a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Nowhere/review.asp?c=5376">Pocket Gamer.co.uk</a> Score : 7/10, Bronze Award</li> <li><a href="http://www.midlet-review.com/index?content=review&id=770&rel=j2me&PHPSESSID=ea574515ca4">Midlet-Review</a> Score : 9/10, Mobile Game Award</li> <li><a href="http://www.mobilegamefaqs.com/reviewfull.php?orig=rev&id=887">Mobile Game FAQs</a> Score : 82/100, Silver Award</li> <li><a href="http://www.projectnext.eu/main-zone/game-reviews/17305-89-100-nowhere-eng/">Project Next</a> Score : 89/100, Next Approved Award</li> </ul> (Please e-mail me if you know of another English speaking review of this game - email address is on my Resume Page) <br /><br /> Furthermore, the game was nominated for two awards at the <a href="http://www.festivaldujeuvideo.com/prix-du-festival.html">Festival du Jeu Vidéo 2007</a>, best scenario and best mobile game.<br /><br /> If you are not yet convinced, you can view this <a href="http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=PzIkvNQPKCk">Game Trailer</a>, but if you are you can already <a href="http://www.clickgamer.com/minicart/infusio/checkout.htm?addpvid=18833">buy this game</a>! <br /><br /> <br><br> <center> Official Trailer <br> <br/><br/> <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PzIkvNQPKCk&hl=fr&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PzIkvNQPKCk&hl=fr&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object> <br/> <br/> </center>

            This J2ME Midp 2.0 Beat them up game developed by the French company <a href="http://www.devalley.fr">DeValley Entertainment</a>
            is the first collaboration project with <a href="http://www.vgmobile.com" />Vivendi Universal Games Mobile</a>.<br />
            <br />
            Just like Holy Wars, this project was just about done when I first started working for DeValley. I was asked to contribute to this project 
            during the last weeks of crunch time and put in a few all-nighters to finish the game on time. I worked mostly on HUD display and some 
            dialogue engine debugging.<br />
