            <b>Asphalt 7: Heat</b> was my second stint on the franchise. After the success of Asphalt 6, we wanted to polish it as much as possible and push the game to the limits of what the current devices could offer.
            The team started bigger then with Asphalt 6, so I was able to specialize a little more, especially with AI and Gameplay. The Game Engine being very similar to the Asphalt 6 one I was also very useful in maintaining it.

            <b>The Spiderwick Chronicles</b> is a J2ME Midp 2.0 Adventure Game developed by the French company <a href="http://www.devalley.fr">DeValley Entertainment</a> 
            and published by <a href="http://www.vgmobile.com">Vivendi Universal Games Mobile</a>.<br/><br/> 
            I was the lead programmer for the development of this project.<br/><br/> 
            This game was created in anticipation of the Paramount movie and was a licensed product designed to target the same audience that the movie and 
            Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's novels appeal to, such as younger audiences.<br/><br/> 
            Vivendi Universal Games Mobile came to us with this project after we had finished Crash of the Titans, around August 2007 it seemed at the time like a good project to look 
            into but one of the demands was very special: they would need the game to be developed in two months with one extra month of debugging, about half the time we usually spend on games. 
            At that time the Paramount movie was expected to hit the theatres around January 2008.<br/> The other developers were already deep into other projects so I was the only one relatively 
            available putting the finishing touches on the game Nowhere, however I had just only finished my first game as a lead developer and that had taken me about 5 months with debugging. 
            The added responsibility did not scare me and for some reason I really felt confident I could get the job done well and in time. Luckily for me I did!<br/><br/> 
            This project succeeded because the two guys I worked with, brothers ( and <a href="http://etienneperin.com/">game geniuses</a> ) Simon and Etienne Perin really did a tremendous job as graphic 
            artist and game designer respectively. 
            The graphics are really top notch and are I believe by far the best feature of the game, and Etienne's work really made everything happen. 
            His early game design documents were right on the money, and thanks to them I was able to schedule almost all the necessary coding tasks from the start of the project, we all put in a lot of extra 
            hours early on and we were so conscious of the tight schedule that we actually ended the project a couple days early.<br/>

            <b>Nowhere</b> is a J2ME Midp 2.0 Survival Horror Game developed by the French company <a href="http://www.devalley.fr">DeValley Entertainment</a>.<br/><br/> 
            I was the lead programmer for the development of this project and also worked on some of the porting.<br/><br/> 
            The really interesting feature about this project was its goal to create a very disturbing atmosphere, always trying to keep the player uneasy 
            yet wanting to discover the rest of the game, just like the feelings that can be experienced when watching a classic horror movie.<br /><br /> 
            I am especially proud of having worked on this game, but to present it a little more objectively, I will refer you to some of the reviews : <br /><br />

            Just like Holy Wars, this project was just about done when I first started working for DeValley. I was asked to contribute to this project 
            during the last weeks of crunch time and put in a few all-nighters to finish the game on time. I worked mostly on HUD display and some 
            dialogue engine debugging.<br />

            This was my first game ever, so I was learning the ropes. DeValley's code was extremely optimized and efficient and I coulnd't have found a better place to start off after finishing my studies.
