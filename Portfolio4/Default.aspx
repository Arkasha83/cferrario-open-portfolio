What I have done?
<br><br></span>

I have worked on five commercial projects with DeValley Entertainement during 2007 and 2008.

<ul>
<li><b>Nowhere</b> (nominated for best french mobile game of 2007)</li>
<li><b>The Spiderwick Chronicles</b></li>
<li><b>Landers</b> (nominated for best french mobile game of 2008)</li>
<li><b>Holy Wars</b></li>
<li><b>Crash of the Titans</b></li>
</ul>

<br>

I also worked on one mobile game for Gameloft in New York in 2008.

<ul><li><b>Spooks: The Mobile Game</b></li></ul><br>

During 2009, in France, I built the game engine as the main programmer for :

<ul><li><b>My Hero: Astronaut</b> ( NDS game sadly cancelled after being shut down during late debugging because of external finance reasons )</li></ul><br>

In late 2009, I moved to Montreal, Canada to join the Gameloft team and worked on:

<ul><li><b>GT Racing: Motor Company</b> ( iPhone - iPad )</li></ul><br>

Please feel free to check out these projects on the <b><i>Professionnal Experience</i></b> tab of this portfolio.

What I can already do
<br><br></span>
		
Most of my ready-to-use experience is in C/C++ game programming, with a strong background in Java Midp  <br>
    heavily optimized programming. Having been a main programmer on three different projects, I have  <br>
    touched various aspects of game programming and architecture design such as engine construction,  <br>
    physics, AI, fine tuned gameplays, audio, animation, menus, portability, localization...  <br>
    I also work a lot on the side or in between projects on prototypes or tools to make my job easier.  <br>
    I have been gaining more and more experience with low level programming and optimization,  <br>
    I also enjoy debugging very much.<br><br>
I am also a very polished team player and play very well with the subtilities of human interaction  <br>
    having worked on many team programming projects in different countries and in different languages  <br>
    but also being on a baseball team for about a decade including some coaching  <br>
    experience as well as being an official umpire.

I know that I can be a very valuable adition to your dev team, but don't take it from me, listen to Chuck!
